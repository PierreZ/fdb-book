# The FoundationDB's Book ðŸ“–

Welcome to FoundationDB's Book! If you are looking to start writing your own datastore with FoundationDB, or if you are curious about FDB, you have come to the right place.

ðŸš§ This is currently a work-in-progress, feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/PierreZ/fdb-book) chapters! ðŸš§

## What This Book Covers

This book aims to be a comprehensive, up-to-date guide to use FoundationDB features and libraries, appropriate for beginners and old hands alike. It is also designed to be an entrypoint towards the FoundationDB's community. This is definitely not designed as a replacement for the [official documentation](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/) or the [forum](https://forums.foundationdb.org/).

* The early chapters provide an introduction to FoundationDB, why it may interest you, and what is a layer.
* The Record-Layer chapter is focusing on the Record-Layer, a Java library to write layers made by Apple.
* The middle chapters discuss key utilities and features provided by the bindings, and describe best-practises to write layers to maximize performance and scalability.
* The last chapters are describing core elements of FoundationDB, such as read/write path, or the simulation framework.
